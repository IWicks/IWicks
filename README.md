## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ§Š I'm a PhD student at Northumbria University, using the MONARCHS numerical model to understand how surface melting on Antarctic Ice Sheets impacts their stability and preconditions them for collapse. I'm interested in firn dynamics and hydrology, ice shelf stress/strain fields, numerical modelling, and all things East Antarctica!
- ðŸ›° Iâ€™ve been working on recreating the CPOM sea ice processing chain in Python, and converting it to track and process iceberg data.
- ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¶ I'm planning on using MONARCHS to inform Ua, a finite-element viscous flow model, to understand how changes to ice shelf integrity and thickness impacts buttressing, ice discharge, and contributions to Antarctic mass loss and sea level change.
