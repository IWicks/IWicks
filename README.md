## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ§Š I'm a PhD student at Northumbria University, using the MONARCHS numerical model to understand how surface melting on Antarctic Ice Sheets impacts their stability and preconditions them for collapse. I'm interested in firn dynamics and hydrology, ice shelf stress/strain fields, machine learning, and all things East Antarctica!
- ðŸ›° Iâ€™m currently working on recreating the CPOM sea ice processing chain in Python, and converting it to track and process iceberg data.
